## The Second Challenge

The reason I built this website is because I wanted to create my own professional portfolio from scratch. Creating a website with no starter code or skeleton was much more difficult than I expected it to be, but that is also what teaches me the most. I needed practice with grids, flex, and buttons with hyperlinks, and this was the project to necessitate that.
