        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <section class="aboutme">Katarina Mihaylovich is a coding student based in Southern California. She prefers to go by the name "Lulu," as that is the nickname her family bestowed upon her during her infancy (so don't worry about pronouncing the daunting Eastern European legal name). Lulu started her college experience at NYU but quickly realized she'd rather go back to her native Los Angeles. She finished school with a Communications degree from USC. Since then, Lulu has dabbled in the film industry, both in front of and behind the camera. She decided to enroll in coding bootcamp through UCLA extension (whoa, rival school) due to her desire to make a lot of money while working from home and not dealing with Hollywood people. She has high hopes in this profession. </section>
